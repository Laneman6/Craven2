Elevator pitch:
You've accumulated ingredients in the fridge that you're not sure what to do with, or maybe you're just in need of some fresh recipe ideas. Its Sunday night and you want to have a plan going into your current work week as to what meals you can make on each given day, and save those plans so that you're not left trying to figure it out each day while running out the door for work in the morning or after coming home exhausted in the evening.

Craven is a tool that allows you to build daily plans for the current week, storing selected recipes pulled from more than a million on the internet, that correspond with some of the key ingredients that you already have to work with, and a full list to identify what you might still need.

Notes:
Beta version! -- Original food API production key stopped working (Spoonacular's Food API). Had to swap for free, open, less flashy API (recipe puppy) - still pulls fundamental information from more than a million recipes, and links to page photos and recipe webpage, but no currently unable to pull in photos as not all recipes on free API have thumbnails - was throwing too many blank pics. Version 2.0 would have paid API (Spoonacular) functioning for "prettier" UX and greater detail pulled to Plan/Options display pages (units of measure on ingredients, pics of dish, etc. all pulled into the app's contained user views as originally intended).
